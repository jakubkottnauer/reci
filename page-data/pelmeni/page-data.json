Then cover with a towel and let rest for about half an hour.</p>\n<p>While the dough is resting, mix the filling. Grind beef in meat grinder with an onion. If you don’t have a meat grinder buy ground beef or whatever meat you’re using and grate the onion on fine grater. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>\n<p>Next get the dough and roll it into a thin sheet.</p>\n<p>I use a small glass to cut out the rounds of dough. But don’t cut too many at once or they’ll dry out. Take the remnants of the dough, roll into a ball, then roll into a thin sheet and repeat (I promised you – tedious).</p>\n<p>As for the size of pelmeni – the smaller, the better. Now put small portions of filling in the middle of each round and pinch the edges close.</p>\n<p>Cover the finished pelmeni with a towel while working on the rest of the dough. If you are making a few hundreds of them, start freezing them.</p>\n<p>Finally, cook fresh pelmeni in boiling salted water for 5-7 minutes. I also love adding some bay leaves and a few whole peppercorns to the water. The pot must be big enough so all the pelmeni float and non stick together.</p>\n<p>Just as you are about to pass out from the mouth-watering smell, your pelmeni are ready. Serve them preferably with black pepper, sour cream, butter and a bit of vinegar.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pelmeni","source":"http://blogs.transparent.com/russian/making-russian-pelmeni/","tags":"russian dumplings russia"},"fields":{"ingredients":null,"relatedRecipes":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/53876ef732ded1a03887efea6eacc86c/a506a/pelmeni.jpg","srcSet":"/static/53876ef732ded1a03887efea6eacc86c/3a9da/pelmeni.jpg 325w,\n/static/53876ef732ded1a03887efea6eacc86c/23f15/pelmeni.jpg 650w,\n/static/53876ef732ded1a03887efea6eacc86c/a506a/pelmeni.jpg 1300w","sizes":"(min-width: 1300px) 1300px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/53876ef732ded1a03887efea6eacc86c/47c81/pelmeni.webp 325w,\n/static/53876ef732ded1a03887efea6eacc86c/fefb9/pelmeni.webp 650w,\n/static/53876ef732ded1a03887efea6eacc86c/1b034/pelmeni.webp 1300w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1300px) 1300px, 100vw"}]},"width":1300,"height":866}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pelmeni/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Place the milk, cold water, salt, sugar into a pan and set over a low heat. Once the sugar and salt has dissolved add the butter. Once the butter has melted, bring to a rolling boil. Turn off the heat then tip in the flour and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon. As soon as the mixture starts to come away from the side of the pan, stop beating and tip onto a plate to cool.</p>\n<p>Return the mixture to the pan, then gradually beat in the eggs, a little at a time, mixing well between each addition, until you have a smooth paste. (Alternatively, transfer the mix to an electric mixer and gradually add the eggs while the mixer is running on a low setting).</p>\n<p>Line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper. Spoon the choux pastry into a piping bag fitted with a large plain nozzle (about 1.5cm in diameter). Pipe a small blob of the pastry mix under each corner of the greaseproof to keep the paper in place. Now pipe about 20 walnut-sized balls onto the baking sheet, spaced well apart. Level the peaked tops with the tip of a wet finger then bake for 18-20 minutes until well risen and golden brown.</p>\n<p>Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before filling.</p>\n<p>For the Chantilly cream scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod into a large mixing bowl. Add the cream, and icing sugar then whisk together until the consistency of a soft meringue with floppy peaks. Spoon the cream into a clean piping bag, fitted with a small plain nozzle. Pierce the base of a choux bun with the tip of the nozzle and pipe in the cream. Repeat with the remaining choux buns.</p>\n<p>For the chocolate sauce, break the chocolate into small pieces in a heatproof bowl. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water and heat. Add the butter and honey stirring from time to time, until the chocolate begins to melt. Gradually whisk in the milk until you have a smooth sauce and warm through. Serve the cream-filled profiteroles with the hot chocolate sauce drizzled over.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Profiteroles","source":"http://www.lifestylefood.com.au/recipes/2057/profiteroles-with-hot-chocolate-sauce","tags":"italy italian dessert sweet"},"fields":{"ingredients":null,"relatedRecipes":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8911ddcf50f9c23654015cf1a875df37/f19bc/profiteroles.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8911ddcf50f9c23654015cf1a875df37/26cfb/profiteroles.jpg 500w,\n/static/8911ddcf50f9c23654015cf1a875df37/1b035/profiteroles.jpg 1000w,\n/static/8911ddcf50f9c23654015cf1a875df37/f19bc/profiteroles.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(min-width: 2000px) 2000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/8911ddcf50f9c23654015cf1a875df37/921bf/profiteroles.webp 500w,\n/static/8911ddcf50f9c23654015cf1a875df37/b7ef5/profiteroles.webp 1000w,\n/static/8911ddcf50f9c23654015cf1a875df37/c9c6a/profiteroles.webp 2000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 2000px) 2000px, 100vw"}]},"width":2000,"height":1333}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/profiteroles/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}

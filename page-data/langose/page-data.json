In the meantime, add together flour, salt and the rest of the milk and after that add the milk-yeast mixture. Mix until a nice dough forms (you may need to add a bit more flour add this point, the dough should not be too sticky). Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for at least half an hour.</p>\n<p>When ready, heat a skillet with a thick layer of oil. Split the dough into 5 or 6 smaller balls and pull it with your fingers until you have a thin flat round shape (the dough should be flexible enough not to tear).

Repeat with the rest of the dough balls.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Langose","source":null,"tags":"hungary hungarian"},"fields":{"ingredients":null,"relatedRecipes":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/45a07c4fbc45b48c146d8cd13d51cca8/3b307/langose.jpg","srcSet":"/static/45a07c4fbc45b48c146d8cd13d51cca8/d9f52/langose.jpg 200w,\n/static/45a07c4fbc45b48c146d8cd13d51cca8/0132d/langose.jpg 400w,\n/static/45a07c4fbc45b48c146d8cd13d51cca8/3b307/langose.jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/45a07c4fbc45b48c146d8cd13d51cca8/b9488/langose.webp 200w,\n/static/45a07c4fbc45b48c146d8cd13d51cca8/47294/langose.webp 400w,\n/static/45a07c4fbc45b48c146d8cd13d51cca8/89c0d/langose.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":533}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/langose/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}

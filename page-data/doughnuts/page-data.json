Stir to dissolve.</p>\n<p>Add yeast into a small bowl.</p>\n<p>Pour milk/sugar mixture over yeast. Stir gently, then let sit for 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Melt butter in separate bowl until butter is almost melted. Stir to finish melting so butter won't be overly hot.</p>\n<p>Add beaten eggs to melted butter, stirring constantly to make sure the butter's not too hot for the eggs.</p>\n<p>Add the egg/butter mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook.</p>\n<p>With the mixer on 3 or medium-low speed, pour in the yeast mixture.</p>\n<p>Allow the dough hook to stir this mixture for a couple of minutes, making sure it's thoroughly combined.</p>\n<p>With the mixer still going, add helpings of the flour mixture in 1/4 to 1/2 cup increments until all the flour is gone.</p>\n<p>Stop the mixer, scrape the bowl, then turn the mixer on the same speed for five whole minutes.</p>\n<p>After five minutes, stop the mixer and scrape the bottom of the bowl.</p>\n<p>Turn on the mixer for 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Turn off the mixer and allow the dough to sit in the bowl undisturbed for 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>After 10 minutes, transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl. Toss the dough to coat, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place straight in the fridge.</p>\n<p>Refrigerate dough for at least 8 hours, or overnight.</p>\n<h1>To Make the Doughnuts</h1>\n<p>Remove bowl from fridge and turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface.</p>\n<p>Roll out to 1/4 to 1/3-inch thickness.</p>\n<p>Using a 3-inch cutter, cut as many rounds as you can, then roll out remaining dough and cut as much as you can, etc.</p>\n<p>Cut holes out of each round using a 1 1/2-inch cutter.</p>\n<p>Place both doughnuts and holes on a floured baking sheet.</p>\n<p>Cover with large tea towel and place in a warm place in your kitchen; my kitchen is very drafty, so I have to briefly warm the griddle, then turn it off and set the sheets on top to keep warm.</p>\n<p>Allow doughnuts to rise undisturbed for at least 1 hour; 1 hour 15 minutes if necessary. Doughuts should be visibly puffier and appear to be airy.</p>\n<h1>To Fry the Dougnuts</h1>\n<p>Heat plenty of vegetable shortening in a large pot until the temperature reaches 375 to 380 degrees---do not let it get hotter than 380 degrees! 375 is ideal; keep the thermometer in the pan to continually monitor.</p>\n<p>One to two at a time, gently grab doughnuts and ease them into the hot oil. Allow them to cook 1 minute on each side; they will brown very quickly.</p>\n<p>Remove doughnuts from the oil with a slotted spoon, allowing all oil to drip off.</p>\n<p>Place doughnut immediately on several layers of paper towels. Count to five, then flip it over onto a clean part of the paper towels. Count to five, then flip it over again; the purpose, obviously, is to drain as much grease as possible before it soaks into the doughnut.</p>\n<p>Repeat with remaining doughnuts and holes. The holes will cook more quickly than the doughnuts; about 30 seconds per side.</p>\n<p>Allow doughnuts to slightly cool.</p>\n<h1>To Glaze</h1>\n<p>Mix all glaze ingredients in a bowl until completely smooth.</p>\n<p>One by one, dip doughnuts into the glaze until halfway submerged. (Note: completely submerge doughnut holes, then remove with slotted spoon.)</p>\n<p>Remove from glaze, then turn right side up on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet (to catch dripping glaze.)</p>\n<p>Serve warm if possible, or room temperature.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Doughnuts","serves":null,"source":"http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/homemade-glazed-doughnuts/"},"fields":{"relatedRecipes":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/doughnuts/"}}}

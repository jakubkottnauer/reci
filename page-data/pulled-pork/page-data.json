Pour the liquid smoke over the pork if using, then fold the foil over the top to make a sealed parcel. Put back in the oven and cook for about 6â€“7 hours, until the internal temperature measures 89C and it's soft enough to spoon. Pour off the juices and reserve.</p>\n<p>Turn the heat back up to 220 and cook the pork, uncovered, for 10 minutes to crisp up. Take out, cover with a tent of foil, and leave to rest for 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>Use two forks, or your fingers to pull into shreds, cutting up the crackling too, and then add the rest of the seasoning, and any meat juices from the tin, and stir in. If possible, leave to soak for 24 hours before reheating in a warm oven to serve.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pulled Pork","serves":null,"source":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/jan/31/how-to-cook-perfect-pulled-pork"},"fields":{"relatedRecipes":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/pulled-pork/"}}}

Add the salt and stir to combine.</p>\n<p>Peel the onions and chop them finely. Add to the melted butter, stir to coat the onions with the butter, and allow to soften over a very gentle heat for 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, peel the potatoes. Grate finely into a large bowl. Add the garlic powder (if using) and whisked egg and stir well to combine.</p>\n<p>Add the cooked onions, including all of the melted butter, to the potato mixture. Stir well to combine.</p>\n<p>Heat the milk in a small saucepan over a high heat until it just starts to bubble at the sides. Pour immediately into the potato mixture and stir well to combine.</p>\n<p>Grease a 2.5 litre roasting dish with plenty of butter and arrange the chicken pieces evenly to facilitate easy portioning later.</p>\n<p>Pour the potato mixture over the chicken pieces and spread evenly. If you like, score the top with the back of a fork to create ridges as the potato cooks.</p>\n<p>Bake the kugelis for 1 hour. I like the top of my kugelis golden, but if you like yours darker, turn the heat up to 210˚C for the last 15 minutes of cooking.</p>\n<p>Allowing the kugelis to cool for 10 minutes before serving makes it much easier to slice as it will set slightly. However, if you just can’t wait, feel free to dive in straight away!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Kugelis","source":"https://myfoododyssey.com/2016/02/28/lithuanian-kugelis-potato-pudding/","tags":"lithuania lithuanian potatoes"},"fields":{"ingredients":null,"relatedRecipes":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#985818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/61abafd34d8f4a777a795d503c6ea7cd/51b4d/kugelis.jpg","srcSet":"/static/61abafd34d8f4a777a795d503c6ea7cd/e2169/kugelis.jpg 230w,\n/static/61abafd34d8f4a777a795d503c6ea7cd/1caaf/kugelis.jpg 460w,\n/static/61abafd34d8f4a777a795d503c6ea7cd/51b4d/kugelis.jpg 920w","sizes":"(min-width: 920px) 920px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/61abafd34d8f4a777a795d503c6ea7cd/c9bdf/kugelis.webp 230w,\n/static/61abafd34d8f4a777a795d503c6ea7cd/51095/kugelis.webp 460w,\n/static/61abafd34d8f4a777a795d503c6ea7cd/137dd/kugelis.webp 920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 920px) 920px, 100vw"}]},"width":920,"height":573}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/kugelis/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}

* 500 g package DeLallo Potato Gnocchi
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 500 g medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
* Sauce
  * 1/4 cup unsalted butter
  * 4 cloves garlic, minced
  * 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
  * 1 cup chicken broth, or more, as needed
  * 1 teaspoon dried thyme
  * 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
  * 1/4 water + 1/4 milk
  * 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan
  * Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook gnocchi according to package instructions; drain well.

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add shrimp, salt and pepper, to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pink, about 2-3 minutes; set aside.

To make the garlic parmesan cream sauce, melt butter in the skillet skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.

Gradually whisk in chicken broth, thyme and basil. Cook, whisking constantly, until incorporated, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in half and half and Parmesan until slightly thickened, about 1-2 minutes. If the mixture is too thick, add more half and half as needed; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Stir in shrimp and gnocchi, and gently toss to combine.

Serve immediately, garnished with parsley.

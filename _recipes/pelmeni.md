* 3 cups all purpose flour
* 1 cup cold water
* 1 egg
* 500 grams minced beef
* 1 onion
* Salt and pepper

Combine dough ingredients in a bowl and mix until the dough is of uniform consistency. Then cover with a towel and let rest for about half an hour.

While the dough is resting, mix the filling. Grind beef in meat grinder with an onion. If you don’t have a meat grinder buy ground beef or whatever meat you’re using and grate the onion on fine grater. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Next get the dough and roll it into a thin sheet.

I use a small glass to cut out the rounds of dough. But don’t cut too many at once or they’ll dry out. Take the remnants of the dough, roll into a ball, then roll into a thin sheet and repeat (I promised you – tedious).

As for the size of pelmeni – the smaller, the better. Now put small portions of filling in the middle of each round and pinch the edges close.

Cover the finished pelmeni with a towel while working on the rest of the dough. If you are making a few hundreds of them, start freezing them.

Finally, cook fresh pelmeni in boiling salted water for 5-7 minutes. I also love adding some bay leaves and a few whole peppercorns to the water. The pot must be big enough so all the pelmeni float and non stick together.

Just as you are about to pass out from the mouth-watering smell, your pelmeni are ready. Serve them preferably with black pepper, sour cream, butter and a bit of vinegar.

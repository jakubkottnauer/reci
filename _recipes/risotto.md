* 2 chicken breasts (or 1 full breast if attached), diced to 1" cubes, seasoned with salt and pepper
* 1 large onion, diced
* 1 bell pepper, bunch of asparagus, or other veg, diced
* 2½ cups arborrio rice
* 2 packages beef or chicken stock, lower sodium is best (2x 14 oz box- you may use less or have to add additional broth or water to cook to your preferred rice texture. I like beef in this even though its a chicken dish because its a bit saltier and has a richer flavor when cooked down, but that is just a personal preference)
* 3 tbsp butter
* olive oil
* salt
* pepper
* diced green onions or peas- ¼ cup
* dry vermouth, optional- ½ cup
* 1 cup water
* Parmesan Cheese, optional


Add diced chicken to 1 tbsp of olive oil.

Cook until browned on all sides.

Add diced vegetables.

When vegetables are slightly browned, add butter and stir.

Lower heat to medium-low, add rice, stir well.

Let rice brown just slightly (think "toasted" for a little flavor)

Add a little bit of stock and vermouth (optional!!)- just enough to keep the consistency liquid.

Stir frequently until rice thickens.

Add a little more stock until it is just barely liquid. Repeat stirring frequently until thickened and adding just enough stock to keep it from burning or becoming too thick.

Realistically, using a regular sized container of stock, you'll use it in about 6ths or 8ths.

When your stock is gone, and the risotto has become thicker, taste a bit of it.

If the rice is too crunchy for your taste, add a little water and proceed with the steps above. Risotto should be slightly al dente- just a slight, teeny crunch when bit. If you over cook the rice, it will become a bit gummy- but its all individual tastes.

Add diced green onions just before your risotto is done cooking- you won't want them to overcook. If using frozen peas, add them with the last addition of stock so they thaw and cook just briefly.

When risotto is thick enough to not spread all over a plate, but not so thick you can shape it like mashed potatoes, it is ready.

Grate fresh parmesan cheese over the top and enjoy!

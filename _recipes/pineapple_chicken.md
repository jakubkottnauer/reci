* Chicken
  * 2 chicken breasts
  *2 Tbsp. soy sauce
  *1 tsp. sesame oil
  *1 egg
  *1/4 tsp. pepper
  *3 Tbsp. flour
  *3 Tbsp cornstarch
  *corn or canola oil for frying
* Sauce
  * 1 cup pineapple chunks
  * 1 cup pineapple juice
  * 1 Tbsp. cornstarch + 1 Tbsp. water
  * 1 Tbsp. soy sauce
  * A bit of rice vinegar

In a bowl, cut 2 chicken breasts into chunks. Add soy sauce, sesame oil, pepper and egg. Cover and let marinate in fridge for at least 2 hours.

Add flour and cornstarch to chicken to create a thick batter. Heat oil in large frying pan on medium high heat. Add chicken and fry until chicken is browned, turning if necessary. Remove chicken from oil onto plate lined with paper towels.

In a medium saucepan, combine pineapples and pineapple juice. Bring to a boil then add brown sugar and soy sauce, and simmer for 5 minutes.

In a small bowl, mix cornstarch and water into a paste. Pour into sauce and stir until thick enough to coat a spoon. Pour chicken pieces into saucepan and mix until thoroughly coated. Serve with steamed white rice.

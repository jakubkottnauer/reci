* 9 g ginger
* 1 stalk green onion
* 2 cloves garlic
* 500 g pork belly
* 50 g sugar
* 1 l water
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* 2 chilis (dried)
* 2 star anise
* ½ cinnamon stick
* 5 bay leaves
* 5 g soy sauce
* 2 tspshaoxing wine
* 5 fermented tofu cubes

Cut ginger into thin slices and green onion into large chunks. Mince garlic. Cut pork into bite-sized cubes.

Fill wok one third of the way full with hot water. Place pork belly in water, bring to a boil, and cook for approx. 5 – 7 min. Strain and set aside.

Add vegetable oil and sugar to wok and cook over medium-low heat for approx. 3 – 5 min. until it begins to lightly caramelize . Carefully add a bit of water to thin out caramel. Remove sugar from wok and set aside.

Heat oil over medium-high heat, return pork to pan, and cook until fat has rendered, approx. 4 – 6 min. Discard excess oil from pan and then add green onion, ginger, garlic, chilis, star anise, cinnamon, and bay leaves. Return caramelized sugar to pan and cook for approx. 1 – 2 min. until all ingredients are evenly coated in sugar. Next, add soy sauce, wine, tofu, and water. Reduce heat to low and cook for approx. 1 – 2 hrs. until volume has reduced by half and sauce has thickened. Add a bit of corn starch mixed with water.

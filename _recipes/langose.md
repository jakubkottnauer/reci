* 1 tsp yeast
* ½ tsp sugar
* ½ tsp salt
* 4 cups all purpose flour
* 400 ml milk
* garlic; crushed and mixed with a bit of water; for serving
* ketchup; for serving
* cheese; grated; for serving
* sunflower oil; for frying

Put the yeast and sugar in a bit of lukewarm milk and let the mixture rest for a minute. In the meantime, add together flour, salt and the rest of the milk and after that add the milk-yeast mixture. Mix until a nice dough forms (you may need to add a bit more flour add this point, the dough should not be too sticky). Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for at least half an hour.

When ready, heat a skillet with a thick layer of oil. Split the dough into 5 or 6 smaller balls and pull it with your fingers until you have a thin flat round shape (the dough should be flexible enough not to tear). Put the dough in the oil and fry from both sides until golden.

When a langoš is finished, put it on a paper towel to dry excess oil and then top it with crushed garlic mixed with water, ketchup and cheese. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls.

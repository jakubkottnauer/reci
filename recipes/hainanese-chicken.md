- **1** chicken
- **2** stalks scallions
- **4** chunks of ginger
- couple of garlic cloves
- lemon grass
- **2 cups** jasmine rice

Trim off excess fat from the chicken, saving it for later.

Scrub chicken with coarse salt and wash.

Scald the chicken with boiling water in the kitchen sink.

Stuff the chicken with scallions, ginger, garlic and lemon grass.

Add water to a pot (just enough so it will barely cover the chicken - the breast should sort of steam and be peeking out from the water). Add 20g salt and 1/2 tsp MSG per litre of water. Bring the water to boil.

Add chicken to the water, gently simmer the chicken for 20 minutes.

Turn of the stove and keep the chicken in water for additional 30 minutes.

Wash jasmine rice, soak it for 20 minutes.

Gently render the chicken fat for around 10 minutes.

After 30 minutes in the water, put the chicken in ice cold water.

Add the rendered chicken fat into a pan and fry ginger and garlic, remove it. Put in the drained rice, add 2 cups of stock and boil the rice until done.

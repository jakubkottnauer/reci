* 3 egg whites
* 6 egg yolks
* 3 +3 tbsp sugar
* 250 g mascarpone cheese at room temperature
* 1 cup freshly pulled espresso cooled to room temperature
* 2 tbsp amaretto or spiced rum
* 3-4 dozen ladyfingers storebought
* cocoa powder for dusting

In a clean bowl, whip the egg whites and 3 tbsp of sugar together for about 3-5 minutes until the egg whites hold stiff peaks.

In a separate bowl, whip the egg yolks with the remaining 3 tbsp sugar for 2-3 minutes until the egg yolks are thick and pale yellow in color.

Add the mascarpone to the egg yolks and whip until combined.

Gently fold the stiff egg whites into the egg yolk mixture and set aside.

In a small flat dish or bowl, combine the espresso and amaretto.

Dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture for 1-2 seconds and place into the bottom of a 8x8 dish, or into individual ramekins. Donâ€™t let the ladyfinger soak so much that it falls apart, just a quick dunk
to let it absorb a little bit of espresso.

Once the ladyfingers have formed a single layer in the bottom of the dish, spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers.

Arrange another layer of espresso soaked ladyfingers on top, and spread over the remaining mascarpone cream.

Cover the top of the dish with plastic wrap and let the tiramisu refrigerate for 4-6 hours.

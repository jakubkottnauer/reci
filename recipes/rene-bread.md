* 2½ cups warm water
* 1 tablespoon quick-rise active dry yeast
* ½ cup sugar
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 6 cups all purpose flour

Mix the warm water, yeast, and sugar together in a large mixing bowl, until nearly dissolved. Mix in the salt and then 5 of the 6 cups of flour.

If the dough is still sticky, add the remaining cup of flour. If it is still too sticky, add another ½ cup of flour. Mix until it forms a ball, and then cover with a cloth or plastic wrap, Let the dough ball rise in the bowl until it doubles in size (1-2 hours).

Divide the risen dough in half and roll out each ball into a large rectangle (the length of your baking sheet). Starting at a long edge, roll each rectangle, until your dough is shaped like a jelly roll. Place both loaves on the baking sheet, with spacing on each side. Cover and let rise until the loaves become as large as you prefer.

Bake at 180 °C for 20 minutes, until it just starts to turn golden.

Immediately rub the top of the bread with butter, to give it a shine, and serve.

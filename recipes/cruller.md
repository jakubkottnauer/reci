- **165 ml** water
- **40 g** butter
- **30 g** sugar
- **100 g** flour
- a pinch of salt
- **3** eggs
- Glaze
  - **200 g** powdered sugar
  - **3-5 tbsp** milk

Mix water, butter and sugar and let the butter melt on medium-high heat. When melted, add flour and mix to combine. Keep mixing on medium heat until a film starts forming on the bottom of the pan.

Let cool down a little bit and mix in the eggs, one by one.

Cut out squares of parchment paper and spray them with cooking oil. Using a large star tip, pipe an even circle of dough onto the parchment paper in one or two layers.

Transfer the dough rings into 180 C oil (including the parchment paper which will peel off after a few seconds). Fry until golden.

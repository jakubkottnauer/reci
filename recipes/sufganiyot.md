* Dough
  * 1 package dried yeast (1 tablespoon)
  * ¾ cup warmed milk or water
  * 4 tablespoons sugar, divided
  * 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
  * ¼ teaspoon Kosher salt
  * 1 teaspoon cinnamon
  * 2 egg yolks
  * 2 tablespoons butter, in four slices and softened
  * 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* Filling and frying
  * 1 egg white, mixed with 1 tablespoon milk, for the egg wash
  * Strawberry preserves
  * Nutella
  * Vegetable oil
  * Confectioners’ Sugar

In a small mixing bowl, combine the warm milk, yeast, and 2 tablespoons sugar. Make sure the bowl is not cold. Mix these ingredients with your hands to dissolve the sugar and yeast, and allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes. Make sure the mixture bubbled.

In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and cinnamon. Mix in the egg yolks, then mix in the yeast mixture.

On a lightly floured board, knead the dough until it forms a ball. Add the butter, and knead some more, until the butter is fully absorbed.

Place the dough in a well-greased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.

Roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/8 inch.

Cut out the dough using 2-inch and 2 1/2-inch rounds. With a teaspoon, drop about a teaspoon of the preserves or Nutella in the center of half of the smaller rounds. Drop a little more than a teaspoon of filling in the center of half of the larger rounds.

Top each of the rounds with its other, unfilled half. Crimp the edges together, and brush with the egg white. Let the rounds rise for about 30 minutes.

While you are waiting for the rounds, gradually heat 2 inches of oil to between 350 and 375 °F (180 to 190 °C) .

Drop the doughnuts into the hot oil, about 4 at a time. After about 1 to 3 minutes, turn the doughnuts, and allow them to brown on the other side for another 1 to 3 minutes. Allow them to drain on paper towels.

Dust with confectioners' sugar, and serve warm!

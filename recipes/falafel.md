serves: 20 balls

- **1/2** large onion, roughly chopped (about 1 cup)
- **2 tbsp** finely chopped fresh parsley
- **2 tbsp** finely chopped fresh cilantro
- **1 tsp** salt
- **1 tsp** dried hot red pepper
- **4 cloves** of garlic
- **1 tsp** cumin
- **1 tsp** baking powder
- **5 tbsp** flour

Let the chickpeas soak overnight, then drain. Or use canned chickpeas, drained.

Place the drained, uncooked chickpeas and the onions in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the parsley, cilantro, salt, hot pepper, garlic, and cumin. Process until blended but not pureed.

Sprinkle in the baking powder and 4 tablespoons of the flour, and pulse. You want to add enough bulgur or flour so that the dough forms a small ball and no longer sticks to your hands. Turn into a bowl and refrigerate, covered, for several hours.

Form the chickpea mixture into balls about the size of walnuts.

Fry until done.

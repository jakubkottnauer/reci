* 1 cup all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup milk
* 2 large eggs
* 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted
* Maple syrup and butter, as desired, for serving

Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. In a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.

In a small bowl, whisk milk and eggs; pour over flour mixture, and whisk gently to combine (don't overmix). Gently whisk in butter.

Following manufacturer's instructions, cook waffles until deep brown and crisp. (For a standard waffle iron, pour a generous 1/2 cup of batter into center, spreading to within 1/2 inch of edges, and close; waffle will cook in 2 to 3 minutes.) Serve warm, with maple syrup and butter, as desired.

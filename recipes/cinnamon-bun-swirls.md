* plain flour (500g / 2 US Cups)
* 2 tsp of dry yeast
* soft brown sugar (75g / 1/3 US Cup)
* butter, melted (75g / 1/3 US Cup)
* 1 egg + 1 extra, beaten for brushing
* milk (200ml)
* 1 orange (tangelo if you have them)
* for the filling
 * dark brown sugar (135g / 1/2 US Cup)
 * 1 ½ tbsp of ground cinnamon
 * butter, softened (50g / 1/4 US Cup)
* for the glaze
 * icing sugar (100g / 1/2 US Cups)
 * 2 tbsp of orange juice

Mix the flour, sugar and yeast in a bowl and add a pinch of salt.

zest half of the orange (tangelo) into the bowl.

make a well in the flour then pour the butter in and stir to combine.

crack in one of the eggs and pour in the milk.

mix the flour into the wet ingredients to form a soft dough before tipping everything onto a work surface.

knead the dough for 10 minutes, until it becomes smooth.

return the dough to the bowl and cover with Clingfilm.

leave in a warm place for 2 hours or overnight in the fridge.

combine the dark brown sugar and the ground cinnamon with a pinch of salt.

roll the dough out into a wide rectangle as thin as possible, using a lightly floured surface.

spread the butter over the dough, leaving a thin border all the way round.

scatter the cinnamon sugar mixture over the butter.

roll the dough into a long cylinder, as tightly as possible and cut it into even swirl slices about 2cm thick.

grab a couple of deep baking dishes and brush them with oil.

place the rolls around the outside of the dish with very little space between them and one in the middle.

cover with clingfilm and leave for another hour, until they double in size and are all touching each other.

preheat the oven to 190ºC.

brush the buns with the extra egg and bake for about 20 minutes, until golden on top.

remove the buns once cooked and cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack.

mix the icing sugar with the orange juice.

drizzle the glaze over the tops of the buns.

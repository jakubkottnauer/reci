* 2 onions
* 1 carrot
* 2 sticks of celery
* 2 cloves of garlic
* A glug of olive oil
* A small handful of pancetta cubes
* Minced beef (750g)
* A glass of red wine
* 1 tbsp of tomato purée
* A tin of chopped tomatoes (400g)
* Beef stock (250ml)
* Butter (50g)
* Flour (50g)
* Milk (500ml)
* 6 cloves
* Couple of bay leaves
* 12 no-cook lasagne sheets
* A ball of mozzarella cheese
* A block of Parmesan cheese
* A handful of basil leaves

Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and add the pancetta and brown.

Dice the carrot, celery, garlic and 1 of the onions.

Add the beef and brown well.

Squeeze the tomato purée into the pan and coat everything.

Then pour in the wine.

Let the liquid bubble for a few minutes before adding the chopped tomatoes and the stock.

Bring to the boil, then turn down to a gentle simmer for at least an hour to allow the mixture to reduce.

Halve the other onion and stud with the cloves.

Heat the milk in a saucepan with the studded onion and bay leaves.

Melt the butter in another medium sized saucepan.

Beat in the flour and cook for a minute (making a roux).

Pour in the strained, infused milk slowly, whisking constantly. Only add more milk once the last has been fully incorporated and is lump free.

Preheat the oven to 180°C.

Spread the meat sauce over the bottom of a rectangle baking dish.

Cover the layer with lasagne sheets, snapping them where needed to fit the dish.

Spoon over a little white sauce and top with torn pieces of mozzarella, grated Parmesan and a few torn basil leaves.

Repeat, finishing with a top layer of lasagne sheets.

Scatter over a final layer of only cheese, then place in the oven for 30 minutes.

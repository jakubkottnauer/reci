* 8 chicken thighs, skin on and bone in
* 4 tbsp hoisin sauce
* 2 tsp sesame oil
* 2 tbsp clear honey
* 1½ tsp Chinese five-spice powder
* thumb-sized knob of ginger, grated
* 2 garlic cloves, grated
* bunch spring onions, chopped
* 50g cashew nuts, toasted
* cooked brown rice, to serve

Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Arrange the chicken thighs in a large roasting tin and slash the skin 2-3 times on each thigh. Mix together the hoisin, sesame oil, honey, five-spice, ginger, garlic and some seasoning. Pour over the chicken and toss to coat – you could now marinate the chicken for 2 hrs, or overnight if you have time. Roast, skin-side up, for 35 mins, basting at least once.

Stir through the cashew nuts and sprinkle the spring onions over the chicken. Return to the oven for 5 mins, then serve with brown rice.

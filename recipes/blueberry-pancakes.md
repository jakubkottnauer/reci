* 3/4 cup milk
* 2 tablespoons white vinegar
* 1 cup flour
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 egg
* 2 tablespoons melted butter
* 1+ cup fresh blueberries
* more butter for the pan

Mix the milk and vinegar and let it sit for a minute.

Whisk the dry ingredients together. Whisk the egg, milk, and melted butter into the dry ingredients until just combined.

Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Melt a little smear of butter in the pan.

Pour about 1/3 cup of batter into the hot skillet and spread it flat-like (it will be pretty thick). Arrange a few blueberries on top. Cook until you see little bubbles on top and the edges starting to firm up. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the pancakes are cooked through.

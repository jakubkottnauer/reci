* 2 duck breasts
* Salt and Pepper


Pre-heat an oven to 200 degrees C.

Score the fat of the duck with sharp knife. Season the duck breasts on both sides with a generous pinch of salt and pepper.

Place the duck in pan cold frying pan fat side down, then place on a stove on high heat.

As the pan heats up and the fat starts to render, fry for about 3-5 minutes until the skin goes crispy. Flip the duck over and sear for 1-2 minutes in the other side.

Flip the duck back on the skin side and put the pan straight in the oven.

Cook the duck for 5 minutes, remove from the oven then let the duck rest for a couple of minutes.

While your waiting, just re-heat your risotto and get it ready to serve.

Slice the duck into thick strips, ladle some of the risotto on a plate, then lay the pieced of duck neatly on top of the risotto.

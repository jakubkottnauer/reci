* 2 eggs
* 2 cups flour
* 1-2 cups (Bulgarian) feta crumbs
* 1 cup yogurt
* 1 tsp baking soda
* butter

Preheat the oven to 180 °C and combine well all the products together and form four equal balls. (If you find the dough difficult to handle, make sure to cover your hands with a good amount of flour).

Grease the baking sheet and then spread the extra flour evenly to prevent the pitki from sticking to it.

Place the pitki on the baking sheet far from each other.

If desired, spread a bit of shredded cheese on top of each ball.

Bake till golden (about 20-25 min depending on your oven). Make sure not to overbake – the interior of the bread should stay soft.

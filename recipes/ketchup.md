* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 medium onion, sliced into half moons
* 2 garlic cloves, chopped (about 1 tablespoon)
* One 1-inch piece of ginger, peeled and chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes in juice
* 1/4 to 1/3 cup packed brown sugar, depending on how sweet you like your ketchup
* 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
* Salt and fresh ground black pepper

Heat oil over medium heat then add onions and cook until they are softened, sweet and lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes and allspice then cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes.

Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until it turns from red to a burnt orange color, about 2 minutes.

Add the can of tomatoes with juice, brown sugar, cider vinegar, a generous pinch of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Stir then bring to a simmer, reduce the heat slightly and cook at a low simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and shiny, about 20 minutes. Taste then adjust with more salt or pepper.

Blend until smooth, let cool to room temperature then refrigerate up to one month.

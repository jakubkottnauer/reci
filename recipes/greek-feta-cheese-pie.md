## For the cheese pie

Preheat oven to 170 C.

In a bowl, add the feta and break it up with a fork into uneven pieces.

Add the gouda, gruyere, oregano, pepper, thyme and basil.

Place a pan over heat. Add the coriander and cumin. Sauté for 1-2 minutes so that they can release their aromas.

Remove from heat and transfer spices to a mortar and pestle. Crush them and add to bowl with cheeses.

Add the nutmeg and mix well.

Brush a 28 cm tart pan with a removable base with olive oil.

Spread a sheet of phyllo dough in the tart pan and drizzle with olive oil.

Spread another sheet of phyllo over it in a crisscross manner.

Spread a sheet of phyllo on a working surface, drizzle with olive oil and add some of the filling.

Cover with another sheet of phyllo and add some of the filling.

Repeat the same process until all of the phyllo sheets and filling are done.

When spreading the last sheet of phyllo, drizzle with some olive oil and roll the phyllo and filling to make a roll, starting from the wider side.

Use a serrated knife to cut into 8 equal sized rolls.

Carefully place the rolls, vertically, over the phyllo in the tart pan.

Turn the edges of the overhanging phyllo inward, to create a nest.

Drizzle the whole pie with any remaining olive oil.

## For the mixture

In a bowl, add the milk, eggs, salt, pepper, some ground nutmeg and the baking powder. Whisk thoroughly.

Pour mixture into tart pan over rolls.

Allow the pie to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes so that it can absorb the milk mixture.

Bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes.

## To serve

On a large chopping board, prepare a salad with rocket leaves, cherry tomatoes, some olive oil, salt, pepper and basil.

Place the cheese pie soufflé over the salad, cut into pieces and serve.

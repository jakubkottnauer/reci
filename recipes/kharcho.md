- 3 lb beef stew meat
- 3 tsp salt
- 4 Tbsp light olive oil (or any cooking oil), divided
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 celery ribs, finely chopped
- 4 cups beef broth + 4 cup filtered water
- 28 oz can diced tomatoes
- 2 dry bay leaves
- 1 tsp ground coriander seeds
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 2 garlic cloves, pressed
- ½ cup uncooked white rice (I used Jasmine)
- 2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice (from 1 medium lemon)
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped, plus more to serve
- ¼ cup fresh dill, chopped, plus more to serve

Sprinkle meat with 3 tsp salt and stir. Heat dutch oven or soup pot over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp oil. Once oil is hot, add beef in 2 batches, sautéing until browned on all sides. Remove from pot and set aside. Don't worry about cooking it through.

Add chopped onion and celery with more oil as needed. Saute 5 min until softened.

Add canned tomatoes with their juice, 4 cups broth, 4 cups water, 2 bay leaves and browned beef. Bring to a boil then reduce heat, cover and simmer 1½ to 2 hours or until beef is tender.

Add ½ cup white rice, 2 Tbsp lemon juice, 2 pressed garlic cloves, 1 tsp coriander, 1 tsp paprika. Cover and simmer 20 min or until rice is tender.

Remove from heat and add ¼ cup parsley and ¼ cup dill then cover and let sit off heat another 10 min before serving. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve with more fresh herbs as desired.

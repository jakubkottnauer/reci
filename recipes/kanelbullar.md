- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons almond milk or whole milk
- 1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast
- 1/2 cup unrefined granulated sugar plus a pinch for the yeast
- 1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk
- 4 teaspoons vanilla bean paste or extract divided
- 3 teaspoons ground cardamom divided
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 3 1/2 to 4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour plus more for rolling the dough
- 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter room temperature
- 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
- 4 teaspoons ground cinnamon divided
- toasted sliced almonds or pearl sugar, for garnish

Heat up milk then combine with the yeast, and a pinch of granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Set aside until foamy, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, the egg and egg yolk, 2 teaspoons of the vanilla, 2 teaspoons of the cardamom, and 2 teaspoons of the salt then whisk until eggs are broken up and well combined.

Slowly add 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour to the stand mixer fitted with a dough hook and knead until a soft silky dough forms (Only add as much flour as you need. The dough should be tacky, silky, and a slack enough that it slightly falls on itself when you set it down. If the dough is sticking to you hands after 3 1/2 cups, add remaining 1 cup flour in 2 tablespoons intervals until you have the desired consistency.) Mix in 4 tablespoons of the room temperature butter a few pieces at a time until well incorporated. Shape dough into ball tucking the ends under so the top surface is smooth.

Lightly spray a clean bowl with nonstick spray and roll dough ball in oil. Cover with plastic wrap or damp kitchen towel, set in a warm place and allow to rise until doubled; about 45 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. When ready to form the cinnamon rolls, prepare the filling by combining the remaining 4 tablespoons of room temperature butter, 1/4 cup of the light brown sugar, 3 teaspoons of the ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of the ground cardamom, 1/2 teaspoon of the vanilla bean paste, and a pinch of salt. Stir until thoroughly mixed.

Heat oven to 180 °C and arrange a rack in the middle. On a lightly floured surface use a rolling pin, to roll the dough a 12-inch-by-18-inch rectangle. Spread the butter-sugar mixture over rectangle all the way to the edge. Along the 18-inch side, mark the dough every 6 inches then use those marks as a guide to gently fold the dough in thirds onto itself so it’s like a closed business letter. Turn the dough so the seam is in front of the you and the open ends are to your right and left.

Trim the edge of the dough slightly so the rectangle is even then using a very sharp knife or pastry wheel, slice the dough lengthwise into 2 centimeter long strips (you should have about 16 to 18). To form a knotted roll, loop the two times rope over your first two fingers then fold it under to tie it into a knot (check out Fix Feast Flair for pictures as to how to tie the rolls). Let dough rise 30 minutes at room temperature.

While the buns are rising, combine the remaining 1/4 cup of light brown sugar with 1/4 cup water, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of ground cardamom (or 3 crushed cardamom pods), remaining 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon (or a 3-inch cinnamon stick), and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste (or a vanilla bean split lengthwise). Bring to a boil and stir to dissolve then sugar then remove from heat.

When the rolls are ready to bake, brush tops of each with the spiced simple syrup then sprinkle with pearl sugar or sliced almonds. Bake cinnamon rolls in the oven about 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown on the bottom and almonds are toasted. Remove from oven, and brush again with the simple syrup; cool slightly before serving.

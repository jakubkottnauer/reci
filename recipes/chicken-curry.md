* 1-2 chicken breasts
* 2 tbsp garlic
* 2 tbsp ginger root
* 2 tomatoes (or a can of tomatoes)
* 2 big onions
* ¾ cup yogurt
* ¼ cup oil
* Turmeric
* Cilantro
* Cumin Powder
* Cayenne
* Garam Masala

Cut the chicken breast into 3 pieces. Marinate the chicken in the yogurt and mix in the garlic and ginger paste for 3 to 4 hours (overnight won't hurt it).

Add the oil to a pot and let it simmer. Add the chopped onions and let them brown on high heat. Reduce the heat to medium when the onions begin to brown. Add some chopped ginger and garlic to the pot.

Mix the salt, turmeric, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala and cayenne with water to form a paste. Add this paste to the carmelizing onions. Slice up the tomatoes and add them to the pot. A good test of knowing when the curry is finished is that the whole mass leaves the oil, the oil separates and everything turns into a nice good smooth mass.

Add the chicken to the curry, put the stove on medium heat, cover it and cook until the chicken is done.

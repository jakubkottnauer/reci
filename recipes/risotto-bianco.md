* 2 tablespoons of olive oil
* 1/2 a brown onion peeled and finely chopped
* 1 stick of celery finely chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic peeled and finely chopped
* 400 g of Arborio rice
* 100 ml of white wine
* 1.5 L of chicken stock
* A big bunch of parsley chopped
* A big bunch of basil leaves shredded
* A big bunch of mint leaves chopped
* 2-3 sprigs of thyme leaves picked and chopped
* 30 g of parmesan cheese grated
* A good pinch of black pepper


Pre-heat a large pot to medium heat.

Add your olive oil to the pot, then add your onions, garlic and celery. Sweat for a couple of minutes and be careful not to brown the ingredients.

Add your Arborio rice and mix through. Then, turn the heat down to low-medium heat, add your white wine.

Once the white wine has evaporated, add about 200mls of the stock and stir occasionally. Keep adding another 200mls every time the stock in the risotto mixture has evaporated. Keep the heat down nice and low,
once all of the stock is added the rice should be cooked.

At this point, you want to turn the heat off. Then, add your parsley, basil, mint leaves, thyme, parmesan cheese and a pinch of black pepper.

Set aside a re-heat when ready to serve.

Grate fresh parmesan cheese over the top and enjoy!

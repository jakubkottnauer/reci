- **4** chicken thighs
- **1/2** cup peanuts
- **5 cm** scallion (only white part)
- **6~20** dried chili peppers
- **3 tbsp** oil
- **1 tsp** Sichuan peppercorn
- Marinade
  - **1 tsp** salt
  - **2 tsp** cornstarch
  - **1 tbsp** cooking wine
- Sauce
  - **1/2 tbsp** dark soy sauce
  - **1 tbsp** light soy sauce
  - **1 tsp** salt
  - **1 inch** ginger grated
  - **1 tbsp** chopped green onion
  - **2** garlic cloves, finely chopped
  - **1 tbsp** cornstarch
  - **1 tbsp** vinegar
  - **2 tbsp** water
  - **1/2 tsp** sugar (optional)

Pat the chicken meat with the back of your knife and then cut the chicken into cubes with similar size. Put in a large bowl; add all the marinating sauce; mix well and marinade for around 15 minutes.

Prepare a small bowl; add all the seasonings for the sauce together.

Heat up around 2 tablespoons of cooking oil in wok and add skinless peanuts in when the oil is still cold. Toss continuously until the oil becomes boiling and there is pa-pa sound. Remove the peanuts out and filter the oil.

Return the oil for frying peanuts back to the wok, heat up the oil until you can see waves on the surface. Slide the chicken in. Pan-fry until the color of chicken dices becomes white (no more stir frying in order to keep the tender taste). Transfer the chicken cubes out.

Fry shallot, pepper flakes and Sichuan peppercorn with slow fire until aroma. Return the fried chicken. Turn up the fire and swirl the sauce.

When the sauce is almost thickened, add deep-fried peanuts. Mix well, garnish chopped green onions and serve hot with steamed rice.

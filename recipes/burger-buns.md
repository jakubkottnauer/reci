Combine flour, yeast and sugar. Mix together water, eggs and oil in a mixing bowl and add the flour mixture.

Mix on low speed for 2 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl, mix 5 more minutes on medium speed. Add salt and mix for 3 minutes more.

Form a smooth ball, place the dough in a greased bowl and let it rise for 1 hour. Divide the dough into 70g portions.

Form balls, let relax for 15 minutes. Reshape the balls, dust some flour over them and let rise for an hour.

Mix one egg and one egg yolk to make egg wash. Brush the buns with the egg wash, sprinkle them with sesame seeds and bake for 12-14 minutes on 220 C.

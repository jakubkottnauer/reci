Melt the coconut oil in a large frying pan then fry the chicken until golden and crisp, remove and set aside.

Fry the onion in the same pan (add a little more coconut oil if needed) until soft and translucent then add the ginger, garlic and spices and fry for another 30 seconds until fragrant.

Pour in the coconut milk, cream and honey and allow to come to a simmer. Add the chicken thighs to the sauce then turn down the heat and allow to cook for 15-20 minutes until the chicken is cooked.

In the meantime, steam the broccoli until almost cooked through and transfer to the chicken and coconut curry sauce to finish cooking.

Season the chicken with lemon juice, salt and pepper and serve.

Spatchcock the chicken, heat up oil and butter (quite a thick layer) in a pan. Season the chicken with salt, pepper and paprika. Put in the pan, breast-side down and weigh down with a pot full of water.

Fry for 20 minutes on each side on medium-low heat.

In the meantime, prepare the sauce by boiling the coriander and garlic in a little bit of water. Add juices from the chicken and boil for a while.

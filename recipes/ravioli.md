* 3 cups flour
* Â½ teaspoon salt
* 2 eggs
* 2 pounds ricotta
* 1 cup parmesan cheese
* salt and pepper to taste

Sift flour and salt together. Place in bowl and form a well in the center. Drop eggs in the well and blend with a fork, gradually adding enough warm water to form a stiff dough. Knead until smooth, cover and let stand 15 minutes. Cut dough in half and roll on floured board into two thin sheets.

Combine ricotta, parmesan cheese, salt and pepper and blend well. Drop teaspoons of filling, about 1 1/2 inches apart, on one sheet of dough and cover with the second sheet. With fingertips, gently press together around each dab of filling. Cut into squares with a pastry cutter, then seal each ravioli by pressing the sides with a fork. Allow your ravioli to dry one hour before cooking.

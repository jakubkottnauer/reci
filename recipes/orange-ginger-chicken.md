* 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite sized pieces
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper
* 2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil
* 1/2 cup orange juice
* 1/2 cup orange marmalade
* 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
* 1 tablespoons honey
* 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
* 3 tablespoons cold water
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* sliced green onions and sesame seeds, for garnish

Place the flour in a large zip top bag. Season the chicken with the salt and pepper, and add half of the chicken to the bag, shaking to coat all the pieces.

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. With tongs, place the chicken in the hot oil and cook until nolonger pink. Remove and keep warm. Repeat with the second half of the chicken.

In the same skillet, add the orange juice, marmalade, soy sauce, honey and ginger. Bring to a boil and stir, making sure to get all the browned bits up off of the bottom of the skillet. In a small bowl, combine the water and the cornstarch, then stir into the sauce. Cook until the mixture has thickened.

Add the chicken back into the sauce and stir to coat. Allow the chicken to heat through.

Serve sprinkled with the green onion and sesame seeds, if desired.

* ⅓ cup vinegar
* 1 bay leaf
* ½ tsp freshly ground pepper

* 1 tbsp honey or brown sugar

Heat oil in a large skillet; rotate to coat sides of skillet. Add pork pieces and cook until meat is browned.

Add garlic and sauté for a minute. Add soy sauce, vinegar, bay leaf, pepper and water.

Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes or until pork are tender. (Watch it carefully. Don't let it dry out .) Add water ½ cup at a time several times until pork meats are tender and desired amount of sauce has been reached. Stir in honey or brown sugar.

Serve over steamed rice.

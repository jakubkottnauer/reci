Mix equal amounts of flour and water (one cup each) and yeast (dry or fresh yeast). You need 1 tablespoon of yeast for each cup of flour. Cover the mixture and place it in your refrigerator for 24 hours.

In this recipe, you will need 180 grams of starter.

Mix the flour, salt, starter, and water in a large bowl, using your hand. You do not need to knead the dough. Just mix all the ingredients together until you get a ball. If the dough is too sticky, add a bit of flour to make it easy for you to roll the dough.

Grease the bottom and sides of a container with a little bit of olive oil, place the dough in a container, cover, and let it rest in a warm place for 24 hours.

Make 150 g balls of dough, sprinkle with flour if needed to make the shaping easy. In a bowl, mix equal amount of both grated cheeses.

Preheat your oven to 220 Â°C.

Roll a dough ball (150 grams) by hand or using a rolling pin until you get a long rectangle. Roll the long edges of the dough rectangle to create an elevation, then pinch the sides of the dough to shape the dough in a boat form.

Add a heaping amount of cheese mixture to the center of the "boat".

Bake the khachapuri for 4-5 minutes until the cheese melts. Once the cheese has melted, remove the khachapuri from the oven, and gently break an egg in the center.

Return the khachapuri to the oven and bake for another 2-3 minutes. Add slices of butter on top of the finished khachapuri.

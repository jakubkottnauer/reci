* Sauce
  * 4 tablespoons tamarind juice (paste) concentrate
  * 1/2 cup water
  * 1/4 cup palm sugar
  * 3 Tbl fish sauce
  * 2 cloves garlic, minced
* Noodles
  * 8 ounces dried rice stick noodles
  * 5 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
  * ½ smallish-medium red onion, thinly sliced
  * 2 cloves garlic, minced
  * ½ lb protein (thinly sliced chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, or cubed tofu)
  * 1 egg
  * 1½ cups mung bean sprouts, divided in half
  * 1 cup carrots, julienned (match sticks), divided in half
  * 4 green onions (scallions) cut diagonal in ½ inch segments
  * ¼ cup cilantro, coarsely chopped
  * ½ cup toasted peanuts, chopped
  * Lime wedges

To make pad Thai sauce, heat a small pan on medium low and add the tamarind concentrate, water, palm sugar, fish sauce, and garlic. Cook the sauce until the palm sugar has completely dissolved. At this point, you will want to carefully taste the sauce and tweak the sweetness or tangyness by adding a tiny bit more palm sugar or tamarind. Be careful, the sauce will be hot.

Remove from heat and allow to cool 10 minutes before storing it in a jar or plastic container.

Boil the rice noodles on high heat for 2 minutes then drain immediately, rinsing the noodles with cold water for just a few seconds. Noodles should be slightly firmer than al dente. Don’t worry, they will continue to soften and cook later when stir frying.

Using kitchen shears, cut the noodle clump in half. This will make it a lot easier to stir-fry and eat.

In a wok of large frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil on high heat. Add to the pan the protein and cook for 2 minutes. Remove the protein and transfer to a plate or bowl.

Return the pan to heat and add a tablespoon of oil. Allow the oil to heat up and add the onions and stir-fry (stir + fry) for one minute then add the garlic and cook for another minute, making sure to stir often enough so the garlic does not burn.

Add the noodles to the pan and drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Stir fry the noodles for two minutes. This will help the noodles soften a tiny bit more but more importantly will provide enough surface texture for the sauce to adhere to.

Add 3-4 tablespoons of the pad Thai sauce continually stirring the noodles until they are coasted with sauce - about a minute.

Add the protein back in and fry for an additional 2-3 minutes, adding more sauce if necessary. You don't want to noodles to be "wet." Instead you want to add a little bit at a time allowing the noodles and the other ingredients to soak in the sauce.

Move the pad Thai over to one side of the pan. Add the last tablespoon of oil to the bare side then crack an egg over it. Scramble the egg with a wooden spoon and cook for 30 seconds.

Add half the sprouts and half the carrots along with the scallions. Mix and stir-fry everything for 1 more minute, frying everything together.

Test the firmness of the noodle. If the noodle is too firm, continue to stir-fry for an additional minute adding a spoonful of sauce if necessary.

Remove pad Thai from heat and serve and garnish with remaining julienned carrots, spouts, cilantro, toasted peanuts, and a wedge of lime. Enjoy!

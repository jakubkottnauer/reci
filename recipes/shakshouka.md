- 1 tablespoon butter
- ½ tablespoon finely minced garlic
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 large tomato, unpeeled and chopped
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- Freshly ground pepper (to taste)
- Sea salt + Ground Pepper (to taste)
- 6 eggs
- Chopped cilantro

On medium heat, melt the butter in a flat pan. Add the garlic and the chopped onion. Cook for a few minutes until the onion becomes golden brown.

Add the tomato to the onion and cook for 5 minute son high heat.

Season with salt and pepper to taste.

After the tomato and onion are done, add the 6 eggs to the pan. Do it carefully, so that the egg yolks do not break.

Gently, stir the egg whites in the pan so that they mix with the tomato sauce and cook.

Cover the pan and let the eggs cook for about a minute or so on medium heat.

Before serving, season with salt and pepper, and add chopped cilantro on top. Eat with bread.

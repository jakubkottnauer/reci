- 400g (4½ cups) dried pasta shapes (I used rigatoni)
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 3 large chicken breasts, cut into chunks
- 1 large onion, peeled and chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, de-seeded and chopped
- 1 yellow bell pepper, de-seeded and chopped
- pinch of salt and pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 1 tbsp tomato puree
- ½ tsp dried oregano
- ½ tsp dried thyme
- 2 x 400g (14oz) tins chopped tomatoes
- 120ml (½ cup) double (heavy) cream
- 100g (3 packed cups) fresh baby spinach
- 8 rashers cooked bacon, chopped
- 100g (1 packed cup) strong cheddar cheese, grated
- 100g (1 packed cup) mozzarella, grated
- Small bunch parsley, roughly torn

Preheat the oven to 190 C. Boil a large pan of water and cook the pasta for 1 minute less than recommended on the pack. Drain.

Whilst the pasta is cooking, heat the oil on a medium heat, in a large frying pan. Add the chicken, and cook until just sealed - about 5 minutes. Add the onion and cook for a further 3-4 minutes until the onion is softened. Add the chopped peppers, salt, pepper, garlic, tomato puree, oregano and thyme. Stir and cook for 2-3 minutes.

Stir in the tinned tomatoes and cream, bring to a gentle bubble, then add the pasta, spinach and cooked bacon. Stir everything together, then transfer to a large baking dish.

Top with the cheddar and mozzarella, and place in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown.
Take out of the oven and top with parsley before serving.

In the meantime, add together flour, salt and the rest of the milk and after that add the milk-yeast mixture. Mix until a nice dough forms (you may need to add a bit more flour add this point, the dough should not be too sticky). Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for at least half an hour.</p>\n<p>When ready, heat a skillet with a thick layer of oil. Split the dough into 5 or 6 smaller balls and pull it with your fingers until you have a thin flat round shape (the dough should be flexible enough not to tear). Put the dough in the oil and fry from both sides until golden.</p>\n<p>When a langoš is finished, put it on a paper towel to dry excess oil and then top it with crushed garlic mixed with water, ketchup and cheese. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Langose","serves":null,"source":null},"fields":{"relatedRecipes":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/langose/"}}

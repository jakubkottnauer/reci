Then cover with a towel and let rest for about half an hour.</p>\n<p>While the dough is resting, mix the filling. Grind beef in meat grinder with an onion. If you don’t have a meat grinder buy ground beef or whatever meat you’re using and grate the onion on fine grater. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>\n<p>Next get the dough and roll it into a thin sheet.</p>\n<p>I use a small glass to cut out the rounds of dough. But don’t cut too many at once or they’ll dry out. Take the remnants of the dough, roll into a ball, then roll into a thin sheet and repeat (I promised you – tedious).</p>\n<p>As for the size of pelmeni – the smaller, the better. Now put small portions of filling in the middle of each round and pinch the edges close.</p>\n<p>Cover the finished pelmeni with a towel while working on the rest of the dough. If you are making a few hundreds of them, start freezing them.</p>\n<p>Finally, cook fresh pelmeni in boiling salted water for 5-7 minutes. I also love adding some bay leaves and a few whole peppercorns to the water. The pot must be big enough so all the pelmeni float and non stick together.</p>\n<p>Just as you are about to pass out from the mouth-watering smell, your pelmeni are ready. Serve them preferably with black pepper, sour cream, butter and a bit of vinegar.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":null,"title":"Pelmeni"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/pelmeni/"}}
